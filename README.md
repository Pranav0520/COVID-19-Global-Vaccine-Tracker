## Problem Statement

This dashboard analyzes global COVID-19 vaccination trends, helping gain insights into vaccination rates, regional disparities, and the impact of GDP on vaccination efforts. It provides a unified view of partially and fully vaccinated populations, identifying areas requiring attention and highlighting global progress.

The dashboard empowers decision-makers by presenting clear, actionable visualizations of vaccination data and its correlation with GDP per capita, enabling strategic planning for improved vaccine distribution.

### Steps Followed

- **Step 1:** Extracted the COVID-19 vaccination dataset from Kaggle.

- **Step 2:** Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
  - Extracted raw data.
  - Transformed the dataset using Python (Pandas) and Excel to clean, validate, and format the data.
  - Loaded the processed data into Tableau for visualization.

- **Step 3:** Designed interactive visualizations in Tableau:
  - A global map displaying vaccination rates by country.
  - Bar charts highlighting top-performing regions in terms of vaccination.
  - A scatter plot showing the correlation between GDP per capita and vaccination rates.

- **Step 4:** Added dynamic filters:
  - Time periods (start and end dates).
  - Continents and countries.

- **Step 5:** Enhanced dashboard design:
  - Incorporated a clean layout with intuitive visuals.
  - Used a consistent color scheme for better readability.
  - Included summary cards for key metrics such as the total number of vaccinated individuals.

### Insights

1. **Global Vaccination Progress:**
   - Partially vaccinated population: 3.83 billion.
   - Fully vaccinated population: 2.94 billion.
   - Unvaccinated share: 51.26% of the global population.

2. **Regional Disparities:**
   - Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Portugal have vaccination rates exceeding 85%, while others lag significantly.

3. **Correlation with GDP:**
   - High-income countries show higher vaccination rates, emphasizing the need for equitable vaccine distribution in lower-income regions.

4. **Trends Over Time:**
   - Visualizations reveal steady progress in global vaccination efforts, with notable spikes during key vaccination campaigns.

### Tools & Technologies Used

- **Data Source:** Kaggle COVID-19 vaccination dataset
- **ETL Tools:** Python (Pandas), Excel
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau

### Recommendations

- **Target Underperforming Regions:** Allocate resources to countries with low vaccination rates.
- **Address Economic Disparities:** Develop strategies to support low-income countries in their vaccination efforts.
- **Monitor Trends:** Use dashboard insights to identify successful campaigns and replicate them in other regions.
